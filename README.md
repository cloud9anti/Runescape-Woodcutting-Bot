# Runescape-Woodcutting-Bot
This script will automatically locate a tree on the screen and cut it, then drop the logs.

This program tries to locate a willow tree on the screen and cut it.
Once the tree has been cut, the drop() function is called.
All the logs in your inventory are dropped if they exist. 
Once it is finished, it begins to cut trees again.
